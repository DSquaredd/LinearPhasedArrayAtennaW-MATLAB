# LinearPhasedArrayAtennaW-MATLAB
A 1D Phased array antenna is designed and analyzed using MATLAB. 

Abstract 
Conditions require 10GHz of signal frequency, 1 dimensional (linear) array with 10 elements, and target field of view of 120°(60° left and 60 °right). By controlling the amplitudes and phases of the individual elements of an antenna array, it is possible to shape the antenna pattern to steer the direction of the beam electronically. The multiple elements in an antenna array are placed together so that the signals transmitted individually are a summation that provides higher gain, directivity, and performance in the desired direction. Phased Array Antennas have been used for radio broadcasting, radar and other applications. They are also being used for wireless technologies like 5G and Wifi-6, which we use every day. When compared with mechanical steering, electronic steering allows for greater flexibility in positioning, decreased mechanical complexity, as well as allows beam scanning at much faster rates.
